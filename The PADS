Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS,

For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. 
Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format: 



select * from (select name||'('||substr(occupation,1,1)||')' 
               from occupations order by name) 
union all 
select * from (select 'There are total '||count(*)||' '||lower(occupation)||'s.' 
               from occupations 
               group by occupation 
               order by count(*), occupation);
